# Recommendation System Project: IBM Community

This project demonstrates the implementation of various recommendation system techniques using real-world data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. The goal is to recommend articles to users based on their interactions with the platform.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  pandas
  numpy
  matplotlib
  scikit-learn
  ```
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for running `.ipynb` files

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hupe1980/dsnd-recommendation-system-project.git
   cd dsnd-recommendation-system-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `starter/Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to begin working on the project.

## Project Instructions

The project is divided into the following sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the dataset to understand user-article interactions.
2. **Rank-Based Recommendations**: Recommend articles based on their popularity.
3. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend articles by finding similar users.
4. **Content-Based Recommendations**: Recommend articles based on their content (e.g., titles).
5. **Matrix Factorization**: Use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to recommend articles.

Each section is implemented in the `starter/Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` notebook.
